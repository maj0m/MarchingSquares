# Marching Squares

This project implements the Marching Squares algorithm using linear interpolation to create an animated visualization of OpenSimplex noise.

Based off Daniel Shiffman's implementation (https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/18cjVoAX1).

My goal was to optimize the algorithm as much as possible, and the result is an ~5x increase in performance (from my limited benchmarks).
