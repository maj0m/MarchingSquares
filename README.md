# Marching Squares

This project implements the Marching Squares algorithm using linear interpolationto create an animated visualization.
Marching Squares is a contouring algorithm that generates visually interesting shapes based on noise values.
In this implementation, a grid of cells is created, and each cell's shape is determined using linear interpolation
of the noise values at its corners.

This is a heavily optimized (~5x performance) version of Daniel Shiffman's (The Coding Train) implementation:
